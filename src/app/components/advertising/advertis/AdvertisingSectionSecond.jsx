            <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Social media marketing</span> is an unpaid marketing
            initiative. This means you don't have to pay to promote your brand to your followers. Social media marketing
            encompasses optimization efforts centered on creating brand recognition, developing meaningful connections
            and driving engagement.

            Paid social advertising, on the other hand, focuses on fine-tuning social media advertisement for better
            reach and higher ROI. Advertising on social media channels puts your brand in front of people who are
            looking for what you offer right now.
